# DESCRIPTION
We implement an application of Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory neural network proposed by **[Shi et. al, 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04214)** in 3D precipitation nowcasting in Kobe city, Japan. We show a significant improvement using this method, in comparision with an optical-flow based method of **[Otsuka et. al, 2016](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/WAF-D-15-0063.1)**

## Architecture of ConvLSTM
